            FOURTH ACT
             _Same as Act II_.

            <p>
                Description:[LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
                pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]
            </p>
            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> <p class= "speech">Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not</p><br>

           <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4> <p class= "speech">Neither do I, father</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> <p class= "speech">I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h4> <p class="stagedirection"> [_Airily_.]</p>  <p class="speech">The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The
            Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the
            Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising</p><br>

            <h4 class="LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p class="speech">Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
            article on Robert Chiltern’s career?</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORDGORING</h4>  <p class="speech">Good heavens!  No.  What does it say?</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p classs="speech">What should it say, sir?  Everything complimentary, of
            course.  Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
            one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
            Canning.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h4> <p class="speech">Ah!  Never heard of Canning.  Never wanted to.  And did . . .
            did Chiltern uphold the scheme?</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4> <p class="speech">Uphold it, sir?  How little you know him!  Why, he
            denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
            This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
            out.  You should read this article, sir.</p><p class= "stagedirection">[_Opens_ The Times.]</p>  <p class="speech">            Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
            Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
            . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
            to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’  They will
            never say that of you, sir.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h4> <p class="speech">I sincerely hope not, father.  However, I am delighted at
            what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.  It shows he has got
            pluck.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <P class="speech">He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.</P><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h4>  <p class="speech">Ah! I prefer pluck.  It is not so common, nowadays, as
            genius is.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p class="speech">I wish you would go into Parliament.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h4> <p class="speech">My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the
            House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDCAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p class="speech">Why don’t you try to do something useful in life?</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING</h4>  <p class="speech">am far too young.</p><br>

            <h4 class= "LORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h4>  <p class="stagedirection">[_Testily_.]</p>  <p classs= "speech">I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It
            is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.</p>/<br>
